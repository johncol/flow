**WCAG 2.x Level AA** is the *baseline accessibility standard* most orgs are expected to meet. If you miss AA, you’re shipping barriers—full stop.

## The 4 principles (POUR)

Everything maps to these. If you violate one, something is broken.

1. **Perceivable** – Users can see/hear the content
2. **Operable** – Users can navigate and interact
3. **Understandable** – Users can comprehend it
4. **Robust** – Works with assistive tech

## Key WCAG AA requirements (the ones that bite teams)

### 1. Color & contrast

* **Text contrast**:

  * Normal text → **4.5:1**
  * Large text (≥18pt or 14pt bold) → **3:1**
* **Non-text UI elements** (buttons, inputs, icons) → **3:1**
* Color **cannot** be the only way to convey meaning

> If your design “needs” low contrast, it’s not accessible—period.

---

### 2. Keyboard accessibility

* Everything must be usable **without a mouse**
* Logical **tab order**
* No keyboard traps
* Visible focus indicator (and not some barely-visible outline)

> “But users can click it” is not a defense.

---

### 3. Forms & inputs

* Every input has a **label** (real label, not placeholder hacks)
* Errors are:

  * Clearly described
  * Programmatically associated
  * Not color-only
* Required fields are obvious

---

### 4. Screen reader compatibility

* Semantic HTML (`button`, `nav`, `main`, `label`, etc.)
* ARIA only when needed (ARIA ≠ magic fix)
* Dynamic content announces itself (e.g. error messages, toasts)

> If you’re fixing semantics with `div + role`, you already messed up.

---

### 5. Text resizing & layout

* Content must work at **200% zoom**
* No horizontal scrolling for normal layouts
* Responsive ≠ accessible (but you still need both)

---

### 6. Motion & animations

* No content that flashes > **3 times per second**
* Motion can be **reduced or disabled**
* Animations shouldn’t block interaction

---

### 7. Media

* **Captions** for prerecorded video
* **Audio descriptions** if visuals convey critical info
* Controls must be keyboard accessible

---

## What AA does *not* guarantee

* Perfect experience for every disability
* Zero manual testing
* That Lighthouse = compliant

AA is a floor, not a trophy.

---

## Common ways teams fail AA

* Custom components without keyboard support
* Placeholder-only form labels
* Focus styles removed for “design reasons”
* Color contrast ignored in disabled states
* Modals without focus trapping
* Toasts/errors not announced to screen readers

These are not edge cases. They’re the norm.

---

## How to actually meet WCAG AA (practical)

1. **Start with semantic HTML**
2. **Design with contrast from day one**
3. **Keyboard test everything**
4. **Test with a screen reader** (NVDA or VoiceOver)
5. **Automate checks**, but don’t trust them blindly:

   * Axe
   * Lighthouse
   * Playwright + axe-core

Automation catches ~30–40% of issues. The rest is on you.

## Bottom line

If your product is “modern” but not WCAG AA:

* You’re excluding users
* You’re risking legal trouble
* You’re shipping lower-quality UI

Accessibility isn’t polish. It’s correctness.
